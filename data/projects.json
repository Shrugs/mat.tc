        "desc": "Fully autonomous Arduino path-finding robot using Depth-First-Search. The build includes a dual H-bridge motor controller setup, along with a custom, recursive path-finding algorithm. The bot is able to solve any maze of infinite size, given infinite time, memory, and energy. So maybe not every maze. But a good many of them, for sure.",
